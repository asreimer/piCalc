# piCalc
Here I will collect a set of algorithms for calculating pi by various algorithms. I will also include algorithms that are capable of calculating the Nth digit of pi.

# Current Status
Currently this repository only contains Python code that can be used to calculate the nth digit of pi, based on the work by [David Bailey, Peter Borwein, and Simon Plouffe](http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1997-66-218/S0025-5718-97-00856-9/home.html).

# Installation

# Dependencies
This code utilizes the arbitrary precision [mpmath Python library](http://mpmath.org/doc/current/). To install this using pip:

    sudo pip install mpmath
